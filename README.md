# JavaScript used to execute the countdown

The JavaScript code in the script.js file is responsible for the countdown timer functionality on the website. It sets a specific date (April 21, 2023) as the target date to count down to, and updates the countdown every 1 second.

The setInterval() method is used to execute a function repeatedly, which calculates the remaining time until the target date and updates the countdown timer accordingly. The remaining time is calculated by finding the difference between the current date and the target date, and then converting that time into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

The days, hours, minutes, and seconds variables are then used to display the countdown timer on the webpage by updating the text of the element with the ID demoClock.

Finally, if the countdown timer reaches zero, the text "EXPIRED" is displayed on the webpage, indicating that the target date has passed.
